## _The library was not tested yet. This comment will be deleted after production test._

## Raspberry PI CM 4

This library is compatible with rpi cm4 module. Was made to use with DF40C-100DS-0.4V(51) connetor.
The library split the pinout in 11 parts for better design. Check the preview project for demostration.
